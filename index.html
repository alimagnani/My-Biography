	<p>Hi, I'm Ali and I'm a sophomore at Manhattan College. Currently, I'm taking four courses at Manhattan College, including Introduction to Literary Study, Introductory Geology, Web Design, and Media Theory and Research. When I'm not attending class or studying, I enjoy spending time with my friends in New York City, horseback riding, and songwriting. Additionally, I like to travel and learn new languages.</p>
