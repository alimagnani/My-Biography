	<h1>My Biography</h1>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, I'm Ali and I'm a sophomore at Manhattan College. Currently, I'm taking four courses at Manhattan College, including Introduction to Literary Study, Introductory Geology, Web Design, and Media Theory and Research. When I'm not attending class or studying, I enjoy spending time with my friends in New York City, horseback riding, and songwriting. Additionally, I like to travel and learn new languages.</p>
	<h2>Major</h2>
	<p>At Manhattan College, I am majoring in Communications with a concentration in Advertising. I chose to major in Communications because as a Singer/Songwriter, I find it important to not only know how to market my own music, but also how to navigate the digital sphere and the everchanging technologies that accompany my industry. Coming from an industry that feeds off of and relies heavily on the media in this technological age, it's essential I not only know how to best represent on multiple media platforms, but also to understand how each of these platforms work. Additionally, by majoring in Communications, I'm able to merge my creative background with more of a business atmosphere, and thus truly be the most successful I can be.</p>
